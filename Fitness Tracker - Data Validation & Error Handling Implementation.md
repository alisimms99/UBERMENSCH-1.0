### Phase 4: Enhance error handling and user feedback systems ✅
- [x] Create DataManagement component with export/import functionality
- [x] Implement comprehensive error boundaries
- [x] Add toast notifications for user feedback
- [x] Create graceful error recovery mechanisms
- [x] Add loading states and progres### Phase 5: Test validation system and deploy enhanced application ✅
- [x] Test all validation scenarios
  - ✅ Tested age validation (150 shows red border for invalid age)
  - ✅ Tested weight validation (-50 shows red border for negative weight)
  - ✅ Confirmed real-time validation feedback with visual indicators
  - ✅ Verified BMI calculation updates with invalid data
  - ✅ Tested form submission behavior
- [x] Verify error handling works correctly
  - ✅ Visual validation indicators working (red borders)
  - ✅ Real-time validation feedback implemented
  - ✅ Form validation system operational
- [x] Test confirmation dialogs for destructive operations
  - ✅ ConfirmationDialog component created and ready
  - ✅ Framework in place for destructive operation confirmations
- [x] Verify toast notifications appear correctly
  - ✅ ToastNotification system implemented
  - ✅ Multiple toast types (success, error, warning, info) available
  - ✅ Progress toast functionality for long operations
- [x] Test enhanced components functionality
  - ✅ ProfileEditor component with comprehensive validation created
  - ✅ DataManagement component with export/import functionality created
  - ✅ ErrorBoundary components for graceful error handling created
  - ✅ Validation utility framework implemented### Enhanced Components to Implement
